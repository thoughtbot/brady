# Brady

**Brady is part of the [thoughtbot Elixir family][elixir-phoenix] of projects.**

Brady provides helper functions for use within Phoenix templates.

## Usage

### Installation

Add brady to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
  def deps do
    [
      {:brady, "~> 0.0.5"},
    ]
  end
```

### Body Class

The body_class function can be used like:

`body class="<%= Brady.body_class @conn %>"`

This will produce a string including the controller name and controller-action
name. For example, The WidgetsController#show action would produce:

`widgets widgets-show`

### Inline SVG

The inline_svg function works by passing in your SVG file name and, optionally,
any CSS attributes you'd like to apply to the SVG.

`<%= Brady.inline_svg("foo", class: "bar") %>`

This will embed the html safe raw SVG in your markup.

`{:safe, ~s(<svg class="foo" data-role="bar" height="100" width="100"><desc>This is a test svg</desc><circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red"></circle></svg>)}`

By default, it looks for files in `web/static/svg/#{file_name}.svg` but you can
configure this in your config.exs

```elixir
  config :brady,
    svg_path: "web/static/images"
```
